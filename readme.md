## Deployment

- Use command **"mvn clean install"** to build single-source executable
- Run single source executable with **"java -jar <filename>.jar"**

## Testing
- Unit tests with JUnit5 framework
  - Used to test each class in isolation
  - Tests for services and controllers are integrated with Mockito to mock dependencies and components
- Integration testing implemented with Postman
  - Used to test overall behavior of the API by verifying each endpoint with HTTP requests generated by Postman
  - Authenticated requests rely on OAuth 2.0, containing the id-token from the Amazon Cognito user pool
- Manual testing by hand (see the [System Test Report](documents/TT222_System_Test_Report.pdf) for further details)
